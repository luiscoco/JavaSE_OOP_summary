**Encapsulation**- Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation

For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.A java class is the example of encapsulation

🌕**Inheritance**- When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism

🌕**Abstraction**- Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction

🌕**Polymorphism**- If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism

Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in **Object-Oriented design**:

☁️**Coupling** - Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class. It arises when classes are aware of each other. If a class has the details information of another class, there is strong coupling. In Java, we use private, protected, and public modifiers to display the visibility level of a class, method, and field

☁️**Cohesion** - Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task. A single well-defined task is done by a highly cohesive method. The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts. The java.io package is a highly cohesive package because it has I/O related classes and interface. However, the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated classes and interfaces

☁️**Association** - Association represents the relationship between the objects. Here, one object can be associated with one object or many objects. There can be four types of association between the objects:
One to One One to Many Many to One, and Many to Many

☁️**Aggregation** - This OOPs concept in Java is symbolic of the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of the state.

☁️**Composition** - It is one of the Java OOPs concepts that represent the strong relationship between the dependent object and the containing object.
